# Dog Watch

The Captain decides it's your turn to keep at watch at night and puts you on *First Dog Watch* starging tomorrow. "Don't worry" he says, "You'll know when it's your turn by the ringing of that bell" and heads off to his cabin for a nap. "But the bell rings all the time" you cry. "How do I know when I'm up next?". You spend the next day paying close attention to the bell-ringing and realise there's a pattern for telling the time.

## Challenge

You keep a detailed note of bell rining throughout the day. Here's what you discover:
