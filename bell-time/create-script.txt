# Below are commands to create a running program (using the "Bell Time" example):

# cd to somewhere you want to create the file (or mkdir a new directory)

# create the empty shell script
touch my-script.sh

# make it executable
chmod +x bell-time.sh

# edit the file with vim (will open and empty file)
vim bell-time.sh

# enter 'insert' mode
i

# add a shebang to tell the shell which interpreter to run
#!/bin/bash

# write a basic output statement
echo "outputing from file"

# save and close
:wq

# run the file
bash my-script.sh

----------------------------------------------------------
NB:

# if you want to quit without saving changes
:q!
