# Kidnapped

You wake to find yourself in a candlelit room full of bones. Another programmer has also been captured by the blood-thirsty pirates and introduces herself to you.
"Hi, I'm Sue".

"How long have you been here?" you ask her. "Three days and 3 nights." she replies. "And there is no way out of here?" you cry. "Well, erm....I found this scroll with some weird text on it, it has the words *OFDEQ* and *IBCQ* which must be a code for something else. I think someone has jumbled the letters to hide the real meaning." 

## Challenge

You `cat ancient-scroll.txt` and realise that if you replace a few of the letters, the words *OFDEQ* and *IBCQ* mean **right** and **left** respectively. Fortunately, you are quite adept with the `sed` command and use it to replace the words, writing the output to a new file.

"What's that door in the floor?" you ask. "I never noticed that before." You realise there's hatch that opens out onto a staircase and hurry through to the next level.
