# Underground Maze

You your way through the hidden latch in the floor, with the scroll tightly in your hand. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you realise you are in an underground maze. Uh-oh, how do you find your way out of here? There must be a clue in the `ancient-scroll.txt`, which you have just decrypted in the previous level.


## Challenge

With the new file as a guide, you navigate your way through the maze `cd maze` to begin, following the path set out in the decrypted scroll. Right before you exit the maze, you notice a map drawn on the wall and you quickly snap a photo of it with your mobile `cp` and save it in a file `root/map.txt` for quick reference in the not too distant future.

- `cp` lets you copy files `cp somewhere/foo.txt somewhere-else/bar.txt`

## Shortcut

"Hang on" says Pete. "Do we really need to follow all those twists and turns? I'm sure there's a shortcut somewhere with `find`".
